# Termily

**This project is currently still in the testing phase. Right now, it is just a showcase of what Termily can do. I do not recommend using it in a real project.**

Hello! This is my own C API designed for making games run on the terminal. The current version is 0.04. The latest release was on April 24, 2024. Termily is not cross-platform and can only be used on Windows. There are numerous planned features for the future, including performance updates.
